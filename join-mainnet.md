## OS/Minimum server spec

- System OS : Ubuntu 18.04
- 4 or more physical<sup>[1]</sup> CPU cores
- At least 500GB of SSD disk storage
- At least 16GB of memory
- At least 100mbps network bandwidth

### Install Go

Galaxy is built using Go and requires Go version 1.16+. In this example, we will be installing Go on the above Ubuntu 18.04:

```sh
# First remove any existing old Go installation
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go

# Install Go
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.16.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Decompress.
# You may need sudo permission.
tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.16.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Update environment variables to include go
cat <<'EOF' >>$HOME/.profile
export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$HOME/go/bin
EOF
source $HOME/.profile
```

To verify that Go is installed:

```sh
go version
# Should return go version go1.16.6 linux/amd64
```

### Get Galaxy Source Code

Use git to retrieve Galaxy source code from the [official repo](https://github.com/galaxies-labs/galaxy), and checkout the `v1.0.0` tag, which contains the latest stable release.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/galaxies-labs/galaxy
cd galaxy
git checkout v1.0.0
```

## Install galaxyd

You can now build Galaxy node software. Running the following command will install the executable galaxyd (Galaxy node daemon) to your GOPATH.

```sh
make install
```

### Galaxyd Version

```sh
galaxyd version --long

name: galaxy
server_name: galaxyd
version: v1.0.0
commit: 941005fd26071b8018bb2107be1077b12e242c88
build_tags: netgo,ledger
go: go version go1.16.6 linux/amd64

```

If the software version does not match, then please check your `$PATH` to ensure the correct `galaxyd` is running.

### Save your Chain ID in galaxyd config

We recommend saving the mainnet `chain-id` into your `galaxyd`'s client.toml. This will make it so you do not have to manually pass in the chain-id flag for every CLI command.

```sh
galaxyd config chain-id galaxy-1
```

### Initialize your Node

Now that your software is installed, you can initialize the directory for galaxyd.

```sh
galaxyd init <your_moniker>
```

This will create a new `.galaxyd` folder in your HOME directory.

### Download Genesis File

```sh
cd $HOME/.galaxy/config/

curl https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/galaxies-labs/networks/main/galaxy-1/genesis.json > $HOME/.galaxy/config/genesis.json
```

### Genesis sha256

```sh
shasum -a 256 ~/.galaxy/config/genesis.json
> 2003cfaca53c3f9120a36957103fbbe6562d4f6c6c50a3e9502c49dbb8e2ba5b

sha256sum ~/.galaxy/config/genesis.json
> 2003cfaca53c3f9120a36957103fbbe6562d4f6c6c50a3e9502c49dbb8e2ba5b
```

### Start galaxyd

```sh
galaxyd start
```

NOTE: If you had run an older binary previously, you might get a panic on start. If so, please start fresh with:

```sh
galaxyd start  --x-crisis-skip-assert-invariants
```
